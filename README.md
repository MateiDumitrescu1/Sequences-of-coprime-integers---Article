The full article can be found as a PDF in this repository. **Please download the PDF file** named `RM12023-pages.pdf` from the repository to read the article in detail.

## Overview
This repository contains the article **"Sequences of Coprime Integers"** authored by Matei-Pavel Dumitrescu. The article proposes ways to analyse sequences of coprime integers, motivated by Problem 2 from ITYM 2021. Key topics covered include the use of the **Chinese remainder theorem** and **Number Theory**.

### Definition
A finite or infinite sequence of positive integers (hereinafter called a SPI) **a1, a2, . . . , ak, . . .** is called **n-prime** if **a1+n, a2+n, . . . , ak+ n, . . .** are pairwise coprime.

### Key Questions Addressed:
1. Which sequences are n-prime for all n ∈ N?
2. Is there a sequence that is not n-prime for any n ∈ N?
3. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence to be n-prime for infinitely many n ∈ N?
4.
